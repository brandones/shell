"""An even better way to run shell commands in Python."""

It's just a fork of [shell](https://github.com/toastdriven/shell) with
`die` and `verbose` set to default to `True` so that it behaves a whole
lot like regular shell scripting.


Installation
============

Using ``pip``, simply run::

    pip install sheller
